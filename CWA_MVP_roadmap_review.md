##FRONT END

#home
- Add text block to the dynamic content lineup for this panel. Users will want this option.
- Add background color to the dynamic content lineup for this panel. Users will want this option.
- Add standalone image to the dynamic content lineup for this panel. Users who do not have any good cover background images will want this option
- Make image, logo, text block, and background color all content options so that user can show/hide the combinations. Then CWA will offer a lot of nice variations for this page.

#about
- Add standalone image to the dynamic content lineup for this panel.
