# Introduction to CRUD with PHP and MySQL

**CRUD** is an acronym that stands for Create Read Update Delete. This acronym describes four essential functions necessary to maintain and use information stored in a database.

**PHP** is a web scripting language that enables web pages to communicate with databases.

**MySQL** is the open-source database platform in use by many web sites to store information.

Here's how they all work together: Web pages uses PHP scripts to interact with web databases. These PHP scripts utilize the CRUD methodology to systematically accomplish tasks of creating, reading, updating, and deleting information in the database.

In short, CRUD, PHP, and MySQL form an essential toolkit for making the information in your web experience truly interactive.

In this introduction to CRUD with PHP and MySQL, we will learn how to set up a web database, code web pages that can talk to the web database, and write PHP scripts that will live on the web pages and accomplish various tasks of creating, reading, updating, and deleting information in the database.

After we develop familiarity with how to work with CRUD, PHP, and MySQL, we will design a simple news feed web page. By applying your new-found knowledge, you will demonstrate to yourself and to others that you can build the most basic version of the kind of information management system that every newspaper website relies on to deliver timely news content.

## Background

### Look, feel, and function

When we envision, design, and code web experiences, we can categorize our objectives into two general categories:

1. What the experience looks like
2. What the experience feel like
3. What the experience does

In user experience terms, these three areas of concern are referred in shorthand as look, feel, and function.

When we are learning about CRUD, PHP, and MySQL, primarily we are learning how to achieve new levels of function.

### Static versus dynamic

### Infrastructure of interactive information

Web pages. Think of web pages (or app screens) as the interfaces that allow the information to move from database to user, and vice versa. Through your web pages, a user can "talk back" to the database by adding new information or updating existing information. As interfaces, web pages need to work. In other words, they need to perform the proposed function. They also need to look and feel appropriate for use.

Web databases. A database is a structure that stores information. Think of a database in the same way you think of a spreadsheet. When placed in a database or a spreadsheet, information can be organized in a way that lets us relate, calculate, and filter that information in ways that give us many options in how we may view and understand that information. A web database is an information storage system that is accessible via the Internet.
