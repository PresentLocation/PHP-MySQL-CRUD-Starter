# Introduction to CRUD with PHP and MySQL

CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create Read Update Delete. This acronym describes four essential functions necessary to maintain and use information stored in a database.

PHP is a web scripting language that enables web pages to communicate with databases.

MySQL is the open-source database platform in use by many web sites to store information.

Here's how they all works together: Web pages uses PHP scripts to interact with web databases. These PHP scripts utilize the CRUD methodology to systematically accomplish tasks of creating, reading, updating, and deleting information in the database.


## Background

When we envision, design, and code web experiences, we can categorize our objectives into two general categories:

1. What the experience looks like
2. What the experience feel like
3. What the experience does

In user experience terms, these three areas of concern are referred in shorthand as look, feel, and function.


In this introduction to CRUD with PHP and MySQL, we will learn how to set up a web database, code web pages that can talk to the web database, and write PHP scripts that will live on the web pages and accomplish various tasks of creating, reading, updating, and deleting information in the database.

When we know how to work with all these things, we will design a simple news feed web page. By applying your new-found knowledge of CRUD, PHP, and MySQL, you will demonstrate the basic information management system that every newspaper website relies on to deliver timely news content.

Web content is compelling because it can provide information that is fresh and relevant

Dynamic content

Web pages

Web databases. A database is a structure that stores information. Think of a database in the same way you think of a spreadsheet. When placed in a database or a spreadsheet, information can be organized in a way that lets us relate, calculate, and filter that information in ways that give us many options in how we may view and understand that information. A web database is an information storage system that is accessible via the Internet.
